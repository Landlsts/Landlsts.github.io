<font size=5><b>MCI Mail - First Commercial Female Service</b></font>
<li>In late 1982, Vint Cerf, one of the original designers of the MCI email service, was one of the main contractors who served from 1982 to 1986 as MCI's Vice President of Digital Information Services.[7] During his time in office, he acted as one of the driving forces behind the creation of the MCI Mail service. Cerf worked on the data networking related hardware and software applications of the MCI Mail.[5] After an eight-year separation from the corporation to work with his Internet partner, Robert E. Kahn at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), Cerf returned to MCI in 1994, where he served as Senior Vice President of Technology Strategy until 2005 when MCI was sold to Verizon.
