<li>YouTube, a social media platform, was registered in 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, former employees of PayPal. The site quickly gained popularity, attracting 30,000 daily visitors and serving over 100 million videos per day by 2006. However, the rapid growth led to increased costs for YouTube, including purchasing more equipment and broadband connections. In 2006, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion, negotiating deals with entertainment companies to allow copyrighted content to appear and users to include certain songs. Google also removed thousands of copyrighted video files from YouTube. In 2008, Google agreed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to show some of their full-length movies and television shows, with advertisements running alongside the programs.
