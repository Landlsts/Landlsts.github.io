<font size=5><b>First colour movie shot Cupid Angling</b></font>
<li>It's important to note that despite claims to the contrary, both Kinemacolor and Technicolor had already produced feature films in color before "Cupid Angling" hit the scene. However, it remains a significant piece of film history as the only feature film to have ever utilized the Douglass Natural Color process. This 1918 silent film starred Ruth Roland and was produced by Leon F. Douglass's National Color Film Company in the Lake Lagunitas area of Marin County, California. It's also worth mentioning that Douglass himself was a partner in the founding of the Victor Talking Machine Company. Not only that, but "Cupid Angling" also featured appearances by none other than Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.
