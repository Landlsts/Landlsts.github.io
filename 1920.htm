<li>The first public demonstration of a real television system is given in London on January 26, 1926, by Scottish inventor John Logie Baird, sparking a revolution in entertainment and communication. In order to convert moving images into electronic impulses, Baird's invention—a visual transmission device he dubbed a "televisor"—used mechanically rotating disks. He based his television on the work of Paul Nipkow, a German scientist who patented his ideas for a complete television system in 1884.
