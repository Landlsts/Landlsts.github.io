<font size=5><b>Invention of Electric Telegraph by George Louis Lesage</b></font>
<li>The electronic telegraph machine was invented by a Swiss physicist and inventor in 1774. Despite its limitations, the device was capable of sending messages for short distances using a different wire for each letter of the alphabet. However, it proved to be too cumbersome for widespread use. It was only after the development of Morse Code several decades later that the telegraph became popular with the ability to send signals using only one wire.
