<font size=5><b>The First Printing Press in the world by German goldsmmith Johannes Gutenberg</b></font>
<li>Gutenberg established the basics of his printing press by 1440, which included the use of a mobile, reusable set of type, and within a decade, he had constructed a working prototype of the press. In 1454, Gutenberg put his press to commercial use by producing thousands of indulgences for the Church, and the following year, he printed his famous 42-line Bible, which became the first book to be printed on a movable type press in the West.

Gutenberg's invention was a combination of various discoveries and inventions. The printing press was built around a traditional screw press, which was a precursor to today's drill press, with an added matrix where individually-cast letters and symbols could be arranged to form the desired text. In order to print a page, Gutenberg would arrange the necessary letters on the matrix and coat them in his ink. The matrix was then mounted on the contact end of the modified screw press and lowered until it struck the paper underneath. Although the process was labor-intensive, it allowed Gutenberg to print pages at a much greater rate than printers using the block printing method or those doing manuscript work.
