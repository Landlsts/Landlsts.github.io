<font size=5><b>Starting of the Golden Age for Television, Radio and Cinema</b></font>
<li>The era of television in the United States known as "The first Golden Age of Television!" was marked by its massive number of live productions. It began in 1947 with the first episode of the drama anthology Kraft Television Theater 2 and ended in 1960 with the final episode of Playhouse 9013, although a few Golden Age shows and stars continued into the 1960s. The Golden Age was succeeded by the network era, wherein television audiences and programming had shifted to less critically acclaimed fare, almost all of it taped or filmed.
<br>
<li>The Golden Age of Radio, which is also known as the old-time radio (OTR) era, was the unparalleled era of radio in the United States. This era began with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting in the early 1920s and reigned supreme through the 1950s. However, with the gradual rise of television, radio slowly lost its position as the medium of choice for scripted programming, variety, and dramatic shows.
