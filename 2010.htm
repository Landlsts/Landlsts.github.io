<li>In 2009, Kevin Systrom, a 27-year-old Stanford University graduate, built a web app called Burbn, inspired by his love for fine whiskeys and bourbons. The app allowed users to check in, post plans, and share photos. In March 2010, Systrom met venture capitalists from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz and decided to quit his job and focus on Burbn. They partnered with 25-year-old Mike Krieger, who had previously worked at Meebo. They reassessed Burbn and decided to focus on photographs taken on mobile devices. They renamed their app Instagram, combining the words instant and telegram, and focused on improving the photo-sharing experience. After eight weeks of fine-tuning, the app was launched in April 2012, with a user base of around 27 million. In April 2012, Instagram was released for Android phones and was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. The company was close to receiving a new round of funding at a valuation of $500 million.
