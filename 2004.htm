<li>In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, inspired by an editorial in The Harvard Crimson about "FaceMash," a controversial site that compared pictures of Havard students' faces. The site violated Harvard's policy by hacking into the school's security system and copying student ID images. Zuckerberg managed to escape expulsion and created a social networking site for Harvard students using their ".edu" email addresses and photos. The site was founded by Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, and was an immediate hit, with around 1,200 students signing up within 24 hours.
