<li>Twitter, founded by Jack Dorsey in 2006, was initially an SMS-based communication platform for friends to keep track of each other's activities. During a brainstorming session at podcasting company Odeo, Dorsey proposed this platform to co-founder Evan Williams, who gave Jack permission to develop it further. In its early days, Twitter was known as twttr, a trend to drop vowels in company names. Software developer Noah Glass is credited with coining the original name and its final form.
