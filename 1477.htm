<font size=5><b>First Printed advertisement in a book by Willian Caxton</b></font>
<li>The earliest surviving printed ad in English was published in 1477 by William Caxton, English merchant, diplomat, writer and printer. This ad announces Caxton's edition of the "Sarum Ordinal" or "Pye", a list of rules for clergy at Salisbury on how to deal with the changing date of Easter.

At the beginning of the 17th century printed advertising was very common and was written by the merchant himself. La Gazette, the first French newspaper established by Theophraste Renaudot in 1631 contained personal ads for those seeking and offering employment, buying and selling goods and services and announcements of all kinds.  In the 18th century illustrations began to appear in advertisements and advertising agents, as they became known, started writing and illustrating the ads.
