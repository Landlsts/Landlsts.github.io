<font size=5><b>First TV transmission by Philo Farnsworth </b></font>
<li>On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth successfully transmitted his first electrical television signal. The same year, he applied for a patent on his invention. In September 1928, he offered the press the first demonstration of his technique while he worked to refine it. In 1930, his supporters at the Crocker First National Bank made overtures to the Radio Corporation of America in an attempt to be acquired by a much bigger business.
