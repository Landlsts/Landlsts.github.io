<font size=5><b>Movable Clay type printing in China</b></font>
<li>Pi Sheng, a Chinese alchemist, came up with the idea of movable type made of clay and glue in the 11th century. He used an iron plate coated with a mixture of resin, wax, and paper ash to compose texts by placing the types side by side. The type was solidified by gently heating the plate and then letting it cool. This revolutionary invention solved the many problems of typography, including the manufacture, assembling, and recovery of indefinitely reusable type. It is safe to say that Pi Sheng's contribution to the world of printing remains unparalleled even today.
