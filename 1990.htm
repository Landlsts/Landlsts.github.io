<font size=5><b>Invention of the Internet, Birth ofSocial Networking Sites, and Emergence of Social Media</b></font>
<li>The history of social media can be traced back to the growth in communications technology since the late 19th century, with Samuel Morse's first telegraph in 1844 serving as a common starting point. However, telegrams do not contribute to a larger community or collective and do not occur "online." The real history of social media starts in the 1970s with the emergence of the internet. The internet's roots can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s when organizations worked to connect computers, marking the beginning of social media. However, it wasn't until the 1980s and 1990s that personal computers became more normal, setting the stage for the emergence of social media. The emergence of blogging and bulletin board systems in the 1990s helped usher in the age of online social networking sites, allowing ordinary people to write about their thoughts, feelings, and personal news, thereby enhancing the significance of the internet.
