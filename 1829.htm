<font size=5><b>Invention of Typewriter by W.S.Burt</b></font>
<li>William Austin Burt is the inventor who patented the first typographer, which is now commonly known as the typewriter. His creation was a rectangular wooden box that depressed a rotating lever, causing ink to be released onto a sheet of paper. As an American legislator, surveyor, craftsman, and inventor, Burt aimed to speed up his writing process, but his goal was never reached due to his machine's slow nature. However, in 1873, Christopher Latham Sholes invented the first practical typewriter, which included the qwerty keyboard that is still used today. It is important to note that Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) purchased his first typewriter for $125 in 1874, and it is believed that he is the first author to submit a typewritten novel for publication entitled "Life on the Mississippi."
