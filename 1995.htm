<font size=5><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer was launched</b></font>
<li>Microsoft is moving away from Internet Explorer, a browser that was once ahead of its time, and focusing on the modern browser IE10 and IE11. Edge, which retains only HTML5 standards support from IE12, is a clean break from the legacy compatibility burden.

The story of missed opportunities and the potential of the web is explored, as well as Microsoft's ability to manage compatibility while staying modern in the ever-changing web standards.
