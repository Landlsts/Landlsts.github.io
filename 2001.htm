<font size=5><b>Instant Messaging Services</b></font>
<li>In 1969, UCLA student Charley Kilne attempted to send the text "login" to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute over the first link on the ARPANET, which was the precursor to the modern internet. Instant messaging became ubiquitous in 1997 with the launch of AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), which used its proprietary OSCAR instant messaging and TOC protocols to allow registered users to communicate in real time. The first iterations of chat programs were functional, with the Talkomatic created in 1973 on PLATO and the Emergency Management Information Systems And Reference Index (EMISARI) Party Line in 1971. Other messaging programs followed, including Yahoo! Messenger, Gaim, and Microsoft's MSN Messenger. In 2000, Jabber created a multi-protocol instant messenger, Meebo, allowing users to chat with friends and access their buddy lists simultaneously.
