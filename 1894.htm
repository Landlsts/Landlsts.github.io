<font size=5><b>Invention of Radio by Guglielmo Marconi</b></font>
<li>Marconi, the winner of the 1909 Nobel prize in Physics, is renowned for his groundbreaking discovery in wireless telegraphy. His revolutionary work led to the development of Marconi's law, which established a direct relationship between antennae length and the maximum possible radio transmission signalling distance. Along with German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun, who also contributed significantly to the radio technology, Marconi shared the 1909 Nobel Prize. Before Marconi's discovery, messages were transmitted using cables laid down on land or under the sea, but with his innovation, Marconi made it possible to send messages wirelessly without requiring any physical connections. The wireless telegraph, one of Marconi's most notable inventions, was first demonstrated in London in 1896.
