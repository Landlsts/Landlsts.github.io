<font size=5><b>DVDs replaced VCR</b></font>
<li>The VHS format, which was popular in the late 70s and 80s, was the epitome of home theater movie viewing. However, the DVD in 1997 revolutionized the industry with its better storage, picture and audio quality, and interactive features. By 2000, VHS tapes were nearly all replaced by DVDs. The LaserDisc technology, invented by David Paul Gregg and James Russell in 1958, was developed and released in 1978. The LaserDisc format used larger discs and less storage space, but its low adoption outside of key Asian markets led to its downfall. The LaserDisc was cool but not yet popular enough to replace the VHS.
