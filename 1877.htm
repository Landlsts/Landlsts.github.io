<font size=5><b>Invention of phonograph by Thomas Alva Edison</b></font>
<li>In 1885, Thomas Edison confidently stated, "I have not heard a bird sing since I was twelve." Despite the mystery surrounding his hearing loss, he went on to invent the first-ever sound capturing and playback machine - the phonograph. This invention was his pride and joy. The phonograph was first invented in 1877, at Edison's Menlo Park laboratory. A cylinder wrapped in tin-foil was used for recording. The user would shout a short message into one side of the cylinder while turning the handle. Inside was a needle which would capture the vibrations of the voice and make a groove into the tin-foil. The recorded message can be played back by using a needle on the other side of the cylinder. However, after a few plays, the tin-foil would tear up, rendering the message unplayable. Later versions of the phonograph played records shaped like cylinders or discs. Edison was so passionate about the phonograph that he referred to it as his "baby" and continued to improve it for the next fifty years.
